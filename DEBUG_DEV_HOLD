[  316.774085] unregister_netdevice: waiting for vxlan0 to become free. Usage count = 7

The above code says that we have done the dev_hold(/netdevvxlan0) 7 times and we have not freed it. The linux kernel tries to do the netdev_unregister,
but it is not successful because of the usage count is 7.

Solution:

do "dev_put(ndetdev/vxlan0)" whenever dev_hold is done.

dev_hold() is done by the kernel whenever we call "dev_get_by_index(dev->ifindex)". In this we have to do "dev_put(dev)" explicitly in our code.

Debug:

dump_stack();
The above function will dump the current call stack.
You can add it in the kernel in dev_hold()/dev_put function

Eg:
dev_hold()
{
if(netif_is_vxaln(dev)) //dump the stack if it is vxlan netdevice
  dump_stack()
}

Similarly we can do for the dev_put()
